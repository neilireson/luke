# luke5
Luke for Lucene version 5

A mavenised version of Luke which works with version 5, and should also be compatible with version 4 indexes,
"forked" from https://code.google.com/p/luke/.

The code functionality is not being maintained, the changes merely get the thing working with the latest version.

To run the code you will need to increase the PermSize available to the JVM (i.e. -XX:MaxPermSize=512m).
